# Floods of the Skagit River and the Surrounding Areas
#### Read Me



### Goal
The goal of the project is to give citizens in the area surrounding the skagit river between Mount Vernon and Concrete a single site source for all of their flood information to help with evacuation.


### Method
We wanted to scrape all the local government sites to find any information related to the Skagit River. Using what we found, which wasnt much, we used the information to build a simple terminal interactive to give back current river height. This would also then return to the user all current road closures and hazards in the area. Giving the user an idea of the magnitude of the flood and which areas to avoid

### Conclusion
After tracking down all the information needed, we found that the areas were short on readily available evauation plans, flood maps, and road conditions, all in one area for local citizens to look towards for leadership on how to safely avoid potentially deadly and damaging floods.
